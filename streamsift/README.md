# StreamSift
StreamSift is an app I developed using the Utelly API to search for movies and TV shows and return what streaming platforms they are on.

## Utelly API
The Utelly API can be found [here](https://rapidapi.com/utelly/api/utelly). All of the data used in the project was obtained by requests to the API; including metadata such as pictures and links.

## Technologies
StreamSift was built with **HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery** over the course of one week. In the future I want to revisit the project and see what improvements and changes I can implement, if any.
